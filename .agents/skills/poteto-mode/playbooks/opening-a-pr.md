### Opening a PR

Use at the delivery stage of a playbook. Apply [the canonical autonomy policy](../../../autonomy-config.md) before remote writes. Preparing a diff or PR body does not authorize publishing it. Continue within the user's existing authorization; if publishing is outside that scope, prepare the reviewable result before requesting the remaining approval. Resolve unavailable tools through [HARNESS.md](../../../HARNESS.md).

**Worktree.** Inspect the working tree and the repository's base branch. Give concurrent code-writing delegates separate worktrees and assign each an explicit branch and file scope. Preserve unrelated work in its current location. If the current worktree is tangled, create a fresh worktree from the intended base and transfer only verified task changes. Destructive recovery follows [Git discipline](../../../rules/git-discipline.md) and the canonical autonomy policy; it is not routine delegate setup.

**Commits.** Commit liberally. Rebase into small, ordered commits before opening PRs. Each commit is a future PR: landable, ordered to tell the story. Amend when the fix belongs in a just-made commit. New commit when separable.

**PRs.** Before committing, review the scoped diff for unnecessary abstractions, duplicate logic, unused code, and comments that restate the implementation. An available `deslop` skill may assist this review; the review also works with native file and diff tools. Read [no-comments](../../no-comments/SKILL.md) for comment changes. Write every PR title, PR description, and commit body with [technical-writing](../../technical-writing/SKILL.md), then apply [unslop](../../unslop/SKILL.md). Apply every technical-writing layer except Diátaxis. Use one word for each action, keep articles, and avoid `-ing` when a plain verb works.

**Titles.** Use Conventional Commits in the form `type(scope): subject`. Use `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, or `perf` as the type. Use the changed area, such as `pstack` or `poteto-mode`, as the scope. Keep the subject short and imperative. Name a real symbol when one carries the change. For example, `fix(pstack): retarget opening-a-pr babysit trigger`. Do not add a trailing period.

**Descriptions.** The PR body is a briefing, not the lab notebook. A reviewer who has the diff should learn why the change exists, what is out of scope, and how you proved the change works. The squash commit body is the PR body. If the body would make the squash commit longer than about 40 lines, cut the body.

Use these sections in order. Drop a section when it has nothing to say.

- `## Why`. State the intent and approach in one or two short paragraphs. Do not list SHAs or rebase genealogy. Do not add a "based on main" preamble.
- `## Scope`. Use bullets to list real symbols and paths. Name both sides of a rename or retarget. State what is in and out only when the boundary matters. Do not write a file-by-file essay.
- `## Tradeoffs`. Name only rejected alternatives that a reviewer would otherwise ask about. Skip this section when there was no real choice.
- `## Blast Radius`. In one to three sentences, name who or what the change touches and why the change is safe or risky. State the continuing cost if main stays red without the fix.
- `## Verification`. Name each real run path and its outcome. For a performance change, report one primary number with its unit in `before → after` form. Link the arena or swarm directory for the remaining evidence. Do not include sample-size methodology, swarm recitals, or metric tables.

After these sections, attach videos or screenshots when they prove a claim. Do not paste full SHAs, swarm or arena lane recitals, lever-correction essays, file-by-file checklists, or "CLEAN" verdicts. Put these details in a linked artifact. Do not use `## Summary` or `## Test plan` boilerplate. A commit body does not restate its subject.

**Forge.** Resolve the forge before the first PR operation and keep that choice for create, edit, view, watch, and merge. GitHub CLI (`gh`) is the default. If `command -v origin` succeeds and Origin can resolve the repository, prefer `origin pr ...`. If Origin is absent or cannot resolve the repository, stay on `gh` and record the fallback. Do not require Graphite (`gt`).

**Size and stacks.** Prefer five narrow PRs to one large PR. A stack is a base-branch chain. The root PR targets trunk. Each child branch rebases onto its parent's exact tip and its PR targets the parent branch. Create a child with `origin pr create --status open --base <parent-branch>` or `gh pr create --base <parent-branch>` according to the resolved forge. Retarget an existing child with `origin pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>` or `gh pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>`. Branch from trunk only for independent work. Rebase on trunk before substantial stack work.

**Readiness.** Honor the user's requested draft or ready state. When ready-for-review publication is authorized and verification has passed, use `--status open` with Origin or omit `--draft` with `gh`. Preserve draft status when the user requests it or verification is incomplete. Run `origin pr view <number>` or `gh pr view <number>` before you refer to PR status.

**Babysit.** Opening a PR does not start a babysit. Post the URL and keep building. Finish the phase or stack first. Run a separate babysit pass only when the user asks for one after the whole stack exists. A babysit for each new PR stalls the build and spends checks on commits that later waves restart. Push back when feedback drifts from intent.

A subagent authorized to open a PR performs the same scoped diff and comment review and uses `interrogate` when its review capabilities are available. It returns the URL and verification evidence without starting a babysit. Return to the parent.
